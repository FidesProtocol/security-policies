# Security Policies
This repo details policies every developer intending to contribute to SkidSec's open source software must follow in order to create highly performant and secure code.
Listed herein is also what parts of our processes we chose to make public for example our CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions soon to follow.

By making all of this public, we hope to lead by example and show everyone in the Ethereum security community how to write secure code and indeed to act as a learning point on what not to do should we fail at any point in our mission.
Contributions from anyone to improve what is listed here is welcome. Anyone can freely adopt our practices as part of their own.
